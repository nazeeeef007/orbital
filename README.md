## ‚ú® Key Features & User Experience Highlights

NutriScan delivers a rich set of features designed to empower users and drive consistent engagement:

### 1. Intuitive Meal Logging & Detailed Macro Tracking
* **Effortless Input:** Users can quickly log their meals, inputting details such as `recipe_text`, `calories`, `protein`, `carbs`, and `fat`. The process is streamlined to minimize friction, encouraging consistent tracking.
* **Comprehensive Meal Data:** Beyond basic macros, our system captures rich contextual information including `cuisine`, `meal_time`, `diet_type`, `spice_level`, `prep_time_mins` (for homecooked meals), `serving_size`, `price`, and even `location` (for restaurant meals). This granular data fuels powerful analytics and personalized recommendations.

### 2. Personalized Meal Recommendations
* **Intelligent Discovery:** Our core recommendation engine, powered by the backend, delivers a curated list of meals tailored to individual user preferences, dietary goals, and historical consumption patterns.
* **Dynamic View Modes:** Users can browse recommendations in a visually appealing **Grid View**, offering a broad overview of options, or dive deep into a **Single View** for a full-screen, immersive experience for each meal. The transition between these views is seamless, enhancing discoverability.
* **Rich Recommendation Cards:** Each `RecommendationCard` is meticulously designed to provide an at-a-glance summary:
    * High-quality `meal_image_url` for visual appeal (with robust fallback).
    * Clear `recipe_text` and relevant `cuisine`/`meal_time` tags.
    * Prominent display of `calories`, `protein`, `carbs`, and `fat`.
    * Contextual details: `prep_time_mins` for homecooked meals or `price` and `location` for restaurant options.
    * A unique `score` indicating recommendation relevance, guiding users to optimal choices.

### 3. Social Interaction & Community Engagement
* **Like & Save Functionality:** Users can `like` and `save` meals, fostering a sense of community and allowing them to curate their favorite healthy recipes. These interactions are reflected in real-time (`likesCount`, `savesCount`).
* **Robust Commenting System:** Each meal supports comments, enabling users to share feedback, tips, and engage in discussions about recipes. The `commentsCount` is prominently displayed, encouraging social interaction and content generation.
* **Optimistic UI Updates:** For interactions like liking and saving, the UI updates instantly, providing immediate feedback and a highly responsive feel. Network requests are handled in the background, with intelligent rollback in case of failure.

### 4. Advanced Macro Analytics & Trend Analysis
* **7-Day Performance Dashboard:** The `MacroHistoryChart` provides a compelling visual representation of macro-nutrient intake over the past week. This isn't just a static chart; it's an interactive dashboard.
* **Dynamic Macro Selection:** Users can effortlessly switch between viewing Calories, Protein, Carbs, or Fat trends with a dedicated, visually appealing selector.
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Beyond the chart, users gain instant insights into:
    * **Daily Average:** Understanding their typical intake.
    * **Trend Analysis:** A powerful percentage change indicator (`trending-up`/`trending-down` icons with color-coding) showing whether their macro intake is increasing or decreasing over recent days.
    * **Peak & Low Values:** Identifying maximum and minimum intake days.
* **Interactive Data Points:** Tapping on specific points on the chart reveals a detailed tooltip, providing precise macro values for that exact date, enhancing data exploration.
* **Intelligent Empty State:** For new users or those with insufficient data, a motivational "Start Your Journey" card is displayed, clearly explaining the benefits of tracking and encouraging continued engagement.

### 5. Seamless User Authentication & Data Persistence
* **Secure User Accounts:** The backend handles secure user authentication and account management, ensuring data privacy and personalized experiences.
* **Reliable Data Storage:** All meal logs, preferences, and interaction data are persistently stored, allowing users to track their progress over time and access their information anytime, anywhere.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Initial Setup & Configuration (Crucial for First Run)

Before launching NutriScan, it's essential to configure the network settings and API keys:

1.  **Frontend (`frontend/config.ts`)**
    * Update `BASE_URL` with your local machine's IP address. This tells the mobile app where to connect to your backend server.
        ```typescript
        // frontend/config.ts
        export const BASE_URL = "http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS"; // e.g., "[http://192.168.68.108](http://192.168.68.108)"
        ```
2.  **Backend (`backend/.env`)**
    * Set the `HOST` variable to your IP address to ensure proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration, allowing your frontend to communicate with the backend.
        ```dotenv
        # backend/.env
        HOST=YOUR_LOCAL_IP_ADDRESS # e.g., 192.168.68.108
        PORT=3000 # Or your chosen port
        DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database # Your PostgreSQL connection string
        JWT_SECRET=YOUR_VERY_SECRET_KEY # A strong, random key for JWT signing
        ```


üí° **How to find your local IP address:**
Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
ipconfig # On Windows
ifconfig # On macOS/Linux (or `ip a`)
